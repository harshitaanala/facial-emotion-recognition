# facial-emotion-recognition
Facial emotion recognition (FER) identifies and classifies human emotions from facial expressions. Using transfer learning, we build a highly accurate FER system by utilizing pre-trained deep learning models. This method allows us to repurpose models trained on large datasets for similar tasks, significantly saving time and computational resources.
